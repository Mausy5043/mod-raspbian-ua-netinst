# mod-raspbian-ua-netinst
Custom changes to `debian-pi\raspbian-ua-netinst`.

Holds the custom files that I need to build my own image of `debian-pi\raspbian-ua-netinst`.

Requirements:
- A clone of the repository `debian-pi\raspbian-ua-netinst` is present in the
same directory as where this repository resides:

```
  .
  ..
  ./raspbian-ua-netinst
  ./mod-raspbian-ua-netinst
```
